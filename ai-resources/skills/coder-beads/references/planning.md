# Beads Planning Reference

Guide for creating epics, tasks, acceptance-review tasks, and beads execution plans.

## Beads issue types

- **epic** — large initiative containing dependent child work
- **task** — atomic implementation or review work
- **bug** — defect to fix
- **feature/chore** — optional project-defined types if enabled

## Planner quality bar

Every execution task must be runnable without guessing.

Checklist:

- clear implementation intent and scope
- concrete instructions (ordered steps)
- explicit file targets when known
- testable acceptance criteria
- no unresolved open questions

If unresolved questions remain, mark the issue for discussion and block it (see issue workflow reference).

## Planning workflow

1. Define epic outcome and success criteria.
2. Break work into atomic tasks.
3. Create an explicit acceptance-review task.
4. Add dependencies so execution order is unambiguous.
5. Label discussion/risk/review cases.
6. Show actionable state (`bd ready`) and blocked state (`bd blocked`).

## Create an epic + acceptance-review gate

```bash
cat << 'EOF' | bd create --title="User Authentication" --type=epic --priority=1 --body-file -
## Description
Implement user authentication with JWT tokens.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Child implementation tasks complete
- [ ] Acceptance review task complete
EOF

cat << 'EOF' | bd create --title="Acceptance Review: User Authentication" --type=task --priority=1 --body-file -
## Description
Verify epic outcomes before closing the epic.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All child tasks closed
- [ ] Required tests run and pass
- [ ] Any discovered defects tracked
EOF

bd dep add <epic-id> <acceptance-review-id>
```

## Create executable implementation tasks

```bash
cat << 'EOF' | bd create --title="Add JWT middleware" --type=task --priority=2 --body-file -
## Description
Protect API routes with JWT validation middleware.

## Instructions
1. Create `src/middleware/auth.ts` with token verification.
2. Validate Bearer token and attach decoded user context.
3. Return 401 for missing/invalid/expired token.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Middleware validates valid tokens
- [ ] Invalid/expired tokens return 401
- [ ] Missing auth header returns 401
- [ ] Relevant tests pass
EOF
```

## Ready-vs-discussion rule

If taskers would need to improvise, do **not** leave task ready.

- use `needs:discussion` when scope is blocked by unresolved decisions
- use `has:open-questions` when mostly-scoped work still has unresolved items
- keep both blocked until resolved

See [beads-issue-workflow.md](beads-issue-workflow.md) for exact commands.

## Execution handoff expectations

Before execution begins:

1. `bd ready` must show only executable work.
2. dependencies must reflect real order constraints.
3. acceptance-review task must exist for epic closure.
4. known gaps must be captured as blocked discussion tasks.
