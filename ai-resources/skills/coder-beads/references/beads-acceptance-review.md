# Beads Acceptance Review Patterns

Acceptance review is a blocking gate that verifies the epic outcome, not just task completion count.

## Gate task requirements

Create a dedicated task per epic:

- `Acceptance Review: <Epic Name>`

Required checks:

- all implementation tasks are closed
- required tests/checks were run and passed
- discovered defects are tracked as bugs/tasks
- scope-level outcome matches epic success criteria

## Reviewer behavior

Reviewer should:

1. read epic plus all child task outcomes
2. verify acceptance criteria against actual evidence
3. create follow-up bugs/tasks for defects or missing coverage
4. close acceptance task only when gate is satisfied

Reviewer should **not** silently reopen scope without a tracked issue.

## Example acceptance-review task body

```markdown
## Description
Verify the epic outcome before closure.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All child implementation tasks closed
- [ ] Required tests/checks completed and passing
- [ ] No unresolved critical defects
- [ ] Follow-up issues filed for non-blocking gaps
```

## If acceptance fails

File follow-up issues and keep acceptance-review task open/blocked until resolved.

```bash
bd create --title="Found: <acceptance gap>" --type=bug --priority=1 --description="Discovered during acceptance review of <epic-id>. <details>"
```

## Epic closure rule

Close epic only when:

1. implementation tasks are complete
2. acceptance-review task is closed
