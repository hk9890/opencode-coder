# Beads Execution Orchestration

Run planned work safely using the ready queue, dependency graph, and explicit verification gates.

## Execution loop

1. Check actionable work: `bd ready`.
2. Pick independent tasks for parallel execution.
3. Move selected tasks to `in_progress`.
4. Execute task instructions exactly.
5. Run required tests/checks for the task scope.
6. Close completed tasks with reason.
7. Re-check `bd ready` and repeat.

## Parallelization rule

Parallelize only when tasks do **not** share mutable files or hidden sequencing constraints.

Use dependencies instead of assumptions.

## Pre-execution ticket review (mandatory)

Before implementing a task:

1. `bd show <id>` and read full description/instructions/comments.
2. If labels include `needs:discussion` or `has:open-questions`, stop execution.
3. If comments contain scope decisions not reflected in the issue body, treat as stale and stop.
4. If acceptance criteria are ambiguous or not testable, stop and comment.

When blocked by quality gaps:

```bash
bd comments add <id> "Cannot execute: <specific gaps>"
```

## Handling failures

- **Task-related failure**: fix within task scope, rerun checks.
- **Unrelated failure**: create follow-up bug and continue if possible.

```bash
bd create --title="Found: <description>" --type=bug --priority=2 --description="Discovered while working on <task-id>. <details>"
```

## Orchestration checkpoints

At each iteration capture:

- `bd ready` (what can run now)
- `bd blocked` (what needs dependencies/discussion)
- `bd status` (overall progress)

## Closure order

1. close implementation tasks
2. run acceptance-review task
3. close epic only when acceptance-review gate is closed
